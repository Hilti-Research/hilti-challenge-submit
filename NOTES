Will be removed after development done.

questions:
- how to export leaderboard -> JSON or HTML? table last year is probably easier constructed using JSON or manually
- should isPublic rather be "undisclosed" like last year?
- is it OK to remove requirement "unveränderte Daten übernommen bei resubmission"? -> UI arguably confusing
- is privacy statement correct?
- how to treat deadline? "latest submission for wettbewerb"? -> probably better to simply disable submission afterwards; participants had enough time.

feedback:
- modified script so teamname is excluded in filename
