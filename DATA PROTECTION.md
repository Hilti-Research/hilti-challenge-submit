# Data Protection

We collect data on the legal basis of DSGVO's [*legitimate interest*](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/legitimate-interests/): 
We only collect data we strictly require to provide the service (the contest). 
We note that it is obvious what data we collect (any data the user personally enters), why we do it (to judge submissions and eligibility of winners of the contest), and for what it will be used (to elect winners of the contest).
When users register, they are made aware of the purpose the data is collected.

Apart from data collected on the legal basis of legitimate interest, we do not collect data. Notably, there is no analytics solution like google analytics integrated. Therefore, we do not need a banner asking for consent.

In the footer, there is contact form linked for privacy-specific queries. Additionally, we offer the voter a zero-traction way to remove all data they submitted, including their personal data (by removing their account).

We note that this also upholds the [swiss data protection](https://www.cyon.ch/blog/neues-datenschutzgesetz-schweiz), including the new version.
